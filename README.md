# CSCI251 – Advanced Programming

### About this repository
This repository contains all the C++ code completed during lectures, labs, classwork, and exam revisions.  
It demonstrates key concepts of **object-oriented programming, generic programming, exception handling, file I/O, and the Standard Template Library (STL)**.

---

## Repository Overview
- **Labs:** lab-1 → lab-9 (each has `main.cpp` and input/output files)  
- **Lectures:** lecture-1 → lecture-9  
  - Each lecture has classwork folders with `main.cpp`  
  - Additional files included where applicable (e.g., `.txt`, `.enc`)  
- **Revision:** midterm and final review codes (`midterm_revision.cpp`, `finals_revision.cpp`)

- Iterators  
- Algorithms  
  - Sorting  
  - Searching  
- Associative containers

## Notes
- Each `main.cpp` file is the entry point for its respective lab or classwork.  
- Comments are included in the code to explain the purpose and logic of each task.  
- This structure makes it easy to navigate by lecture, lab, or concept.

## Technologies Used
- C++ 
- Visual Studio / IDE  
- Standard Template Library (STL)
